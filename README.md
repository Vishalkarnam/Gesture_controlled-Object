Gesture-Controlled Object Movement System

Overview

The Gesture-Controlled Object Movement System utilizes hand gestures to control the movement of an object within a digital environment. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to track hand movements and translate them into actionable commands.

Features

Real-time hand gesture recognition

Smooth and responsive object movement

Integration with various libraries for efficient processing

User-friendly interface

Technologies Used

The project is developed using the following libraries:

1.OpenCV: For image processing and real-time hand tracking

2.MediaPipe: For efficient hand landmark detection

3.NumPy: For numerical computations and matrix operations

4.Pygame: For rendering the graphical interface and object movement
